🌡️ Temperature Conversion — Level 1 Task 2

This task delivers a simple Python program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The user enters a temperature value along with its unit, and the program returns the converted temperature instantly.

🚀 Task Overview:

Accept a temperature value from the user

Accept the unit of measurement (C or F)

Convert the temperature to the opposite unit

Display the final converted value

🧠 Solution Logic:

We follow the traditional formula-based conversion approach:

Celsius → Fahrenheit:
F = (C × 9/5) + 32

Fahrenheit → Celsius:
C = (F − 32) × 5/9

📌 How to Run:

1)Save the script as temperature_converter.py

2)Run it using:

python temperature_converter.py

3)Enter the temperature + unit when prompted

📎 Key Takeaways

1)Simple user input

2)Classic formula-based conversion

3)Works for both C → F and F → C
